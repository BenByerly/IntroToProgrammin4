The Zoo Management Program is designed to help users manage a collection of creatures in a virtual zoo. It allows users to add new creatures with details such as name, description, average length and height, location, danger status, and care costs. Users can delete creatures from the list by entering their names, and they can print the details of all housed creatures, which includes information about their dimensions, locations, danger status, and associated care expenses. The program also calculates and displays the weekly cost for each creature based on care hours, cost per hour, and additional expenses, along with a total cost summary. Additionally, users can save the current list of creatures and their details to a text file for future reference. The program utilizes two primary structures, Cost and Creatures, to efficiently manage the relevant information about each creature.
